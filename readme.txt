Update 2024-08-20

This folder has been under construction since some time around early 2023, with materials being added sporadically since then.

As of this update, all materials have been organized into folders, either based on author, region or topic, depending on the breadth of the given label.
For example, The USSR is a topic in itself, rather than being divided by author or given region within the Union, because the USSR is a substantial and cohesive topic with materials spread across many authors, some relatively unknown, as well as many primary sources from the era. On the other hand, Lenin has his own folder, due to the significance of his works being relevant as a standalone topic of investigation beyond, but of course not exlusive of, the Soviet Union. That being said, the USSR can be consider a region in itself, but also a political entity, and a civilizational template, depending on the observer. Therefore, whether the method of organization is appropriate is a matter of subjectivity, and we do not claim that ours is decisive, or even correct. 

In terms of specific regions, China, Vietnam, and Korea have their own folders, but the Phillipines, Indonesia, and Singapore do not. This may change as I accumulate more materials on relevant movements written from and about those regions.

This leads me to the next point: perspective. As of now, each folder contains, or at least does not differentiate between, works from both the insider and outsider perspecive of a given event or region. Therefore, the folder on China may contain works from both Western analysts/historians, as well as Chinese scholars. This system is far from ideal, not least due to the fact that the Western perspective is often highly skewed, whether well-intended or not; therefore, we will think of a better way to address this contradiction in future updates.

For those who come across this folder of resources, happy reading, and may the bright light of Truth never cease to grace you with its glorious rays.
